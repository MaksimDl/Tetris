so it started to work. Have some bugs (I konow.). 
It's written uses no classes (shame on me didn't learn yet)
I'll come to fix and improve it a bit later, using classes.
So fr right now it is version. 0.01 =) My children already played =)
I'll fix and improve it in about couple months, when I come back to it with more skills =)
If someone read it - thanks a lot =)
